# Data Science Challenge Bain

## Overview

This repository contains the code and insights for the data science challenge proposed by Bain.

## Ideas

- train, validation, test split.
   - do the data analysis only on the train set

- Use automl to find the best model
- Use ensemble in the end
- Make a docker image with the final model for production
- Make a hierarquical model for the states or other thing


- On the data exploration use a brazil map to get insights
